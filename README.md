# Story-time

The sky was pitch black, dark clouds gathered fast. Thunder striked and she shivered. Fat droplets of rain dripped unto her hair, soaking her tattered shirt.

The whole concept of git is that it helps you track the changes made to a file, folder or an entire project.

In this case we will be tracking the changes made to the README file and after all is done we push it to the central/remote repo so that we can have access to it in the future.
